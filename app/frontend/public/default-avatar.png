# Default Avatar Image Placeholder

This file indicates where the default avatar image should be placed.

In a real implementation, you would:
1. Add a default avatar image (e.g., a generic user silhouette) to this location
2. The image should be named "default-avatar.png"
3. Recommended size: 200x200 pixels or larger
4. Format: PNG with transparency

For now, the components will use this placeholder and you can replace it with an actual image later.
